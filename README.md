# Train-Scheduler

[Click here to view](https://copperco.github.io/Train-Scheduler/index.html)

I have created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. I also used Moment.js for the timing. This will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
